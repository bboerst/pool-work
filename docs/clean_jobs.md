# Clean Jobs

According to the wiki at: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Stratum_mining_protocol

Clean Jobs. If true, miners should abort their current work and immediately use the new job, even if it degrades hashrate in the short term. If false, they can still use the current job, but should move to the new one as soon as possible without impacting hashrate.
