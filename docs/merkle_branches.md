# Merkle Tree

A Merkle tree, also known as a hash tree, is a data structure used in Bitcoin to efficiently summarize and verify the integrity of large sets of data, such as transactions in a block. It is a tree-like structure where each leaf node represents a transaction, and each non-leaf node is a hash of its child nodes.

The Merkle root, located at the top of the tree, is a single hash value that represents all the transactions in the block.

## Merkle Branches

Merkle branches are the paths from the leaves (transactions) to the Merkle root. They consist of the hashes needed to reconstruct the Merkle root from a particular transaction.

When mining pools send work to miners, they include Merkle branches in the "mining.notify" message. These branches allow miners to construct the Merkle tree and calculate the Merkle root without having all the transactions in the block.

```
           Merkle Root
              /   \
            /       \
          /           \
        /               \
      /                   \
    /                       \
 Hash(Tx1 + Tx2)         Hash(Tx3 + Tx4)
    /       \               /       \
  Tx1       Tx2           Tx3       Tx4
```

In the example above, if a miner receives Tx1 and its Merkle branch, they can calculate the Merkle root by hashing Tx1 with Tx2 (from the branch) and then hashing the result with Hash(Tx3 + Tx4) (also from the branch).

## Coinbase Transaction and Extranonce
The coinbase transaction is a special transaction in each block that rewards the miner or mining pool for their work. Mining pools send a partial coinbase transaction to miners, leaving room for the miner to fill in the extranonce information.

The extranonce is a value that miners change to modify the block header and find a valid solution. By allowing miners to modify the coinbase transaction, pools enable miners to search a larger space for valid blocks without constantly requesting new work from the pool.

After adding the extranonce to the coinbase transaction, miners complete the Merkle tree by calculating the Merkle root, including the coinbase transaction.

## First Transaction After Coinbase

Interestingly, the first transaction in a block after the coinbase transaction is not hashed in the Merkle tree branches data coming from the mining pool. This is because in order to build the final merkle tree, the coinbase transaction is hashed with the transaction next to it. This means that we can see the transaction ID and look it up in a mempool to get the fee rate.

```

                          /                        \
                         /                          \
                        /                            \
                       /                              \
                      /                                \
                     /                                  \
                    /                                    \
           Hash(Coinbase + Tx1)                  Hash(Tx2 + Tx3 + ...)
                   /    \                                  |
                  /      \                                 |
                 /        \                                |
                /          \                               |

              /              \                             |
             /                \                            |
            /                  \                           |
   Coinbase Transaction        Tx1                  Merkle Branches
           |                    |                  (Hashes of Tx2, Tx3, ...)
           |                    |
  (Partial, missing       (First transaction

```

If the fee rate of the first transaction is unusually low, it may indicate that the pool is including an out-of-band transaction not chosen based on the fee rate.

By understanding Merkle branches, the coinbase transaction, and the first transaction after the coinbase, you can better interpret the data in the table and identify potential similarities between mining pools, such as shared block templates and out of band 'first' transactions.
